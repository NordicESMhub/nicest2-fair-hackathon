### Price

Free of charge, funded by the [Nordic e-Infrastructure
Collaboration](https://neic.no/).


### Hackathon goals and format

From FAIR principles to FAIR practices. This hackathon is a combination of training (March 11, 2021) and 
hands-on hacking using real climate data (16-17 March, 2021)!

The goal is to take a bottom up approach to explore how the current
international standards and tools for managing climate model output (including 
[ES-DOC](https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/es-doc-models/), [CF](https://cfconventions.org/),
[CMOR](https://cmor.llnl.gov/), [ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov/), _etc._) can
be reused in Nordic and national research projects to help ensure the valuable climate model
outputs are FAIR and open. We will use real-world output from two global climate models 
([NorESM](https://www.noresm.org/) and [EC-Earth](http://www.ec-earth.org/)), and plan to work through 
the process of generating comprehensive metadata from the raw model simulation output. 
How metadata generation fits into the research workflow and data management will also be considered.

A report on the outcomes of this hackathon will be written and made publicly available.

### Requirements

We will be using the [EOSC-Nordic JupyterLab](https://eosc-nordic.uiogeo-apps.sigma2.no/hub/login) so there is no need to install anything but:
- You need a laptop or desktop computer with a modern web browser.
- Once registered and close to the event, you will receive some information on how to register and access the [EOSC-Nordic JupyterLab](https://eosc-nordic.uiogeo-apps.sigma2.no/hub/login). We will organize a "check your access" session before the hackathon where we can help you to go through the steps.

registered participants.


### Who the hackathon is for

From FAIR experts to climate modellers.

Are you doing one of these things?
- You help researchers to make their data FAIR.
- You write code to process climate data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in climate research by you or others.

If yes, then this hackathon is for you.

### How to join

We have a limited number of seats. Priority seats are given to NICEST2 staff.

To ensure a balanced mix of participants we warmly invite both climate researchers and research data managers.

 Please use the [NeIC indico page](https://indico.neic.no/event/177/overview) to register your interest.

**As an attendees, we request you to be able to contribute a minimum of 30 hours (including the hackathon itself)**.
