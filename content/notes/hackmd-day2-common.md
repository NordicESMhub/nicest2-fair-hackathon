## Day-2 presentation from Joakim (DMP)

Ask questions below:

- Tool to get a score for the FAIRness https://f-uji.net/
- Is there a way to directly get a score for the DMP?
    - It is not possible in DMPOnline, but possibly in the Data Stewardshap Wizard
- Is f-uji tool usable for DMP only?
    - No, Fuji is usable only for datasets. If you have a dataset with an identifier then you can use the tool to check the FAIRness. All the tool does is to access the page and try to see if it can find links to information. It doesn't check the quality of the metadata.
- How does the Fuji score compare with the DMP score?
- Are DMPs compulsory in Sweden?
    - Depends on the funder, but in most cases they are.
- Is the API "accessible" to end-users?
    - Probably not (one needs to be admin)
    - But can be downloaded (in different formats)
