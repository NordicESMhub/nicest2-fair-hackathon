# Cookbook / DMP work group, Day 2 (Tuesday)


## FAIR cookbooks

Background: https://fairplus.github.io/the-fair-cookbook/content/home.html


### Create a starting template

What platform/technology should we use for a cookbook? Jupyter book?, jupyter notebook? Github. 

- For the use case: Understand what resources are already available. Going forward make sure we have contact with the Bolin centre database managers.



### CMORization - reengineered for research

[ACDD](https://wiki.esipfed.org/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3 ) + [CF](https://cfconventions.org/). Discussion.

Can we test an example of ACDD + CF - is that sufficient metadata for describing research output?

Q. Is ACDD exetensible? At present it seems to be more taylored to measurements rather than model data. Is there a process for adding new attributes?


### Measuring FAIRness: climate data stored on NIRD

Tyge demonstrates NIRD storage/DMP. Test this information in f-uji.net. Testable by:

https://www.f-uji.net/index.php 

Enter the DOI of the dataset. 


### Propagating information from DMP to workflow

Information from DMPs should be used to populate metadata (via a cookbook recipe).


## Discussion

- How should we use FAIRness measures? They should not be used to *game* the system as this doesn't necessarily improve the usefulness/(re)usability of the data. Remember, the FAIRness measure is a combination of the FAIRness of the data itself and the repository/archive.

- Separating metadata and data. Data files should be self describing and contain rich metadata. However metadata should also be extracted into a *Data Index* or *Data Catalogue* that does not store the datasets themselves but provides information about where the datasets can be obtained from. Therefore, Data Catalogues are often used to index the content of â€˜Data Repositories and Data Archives.

- For publication of workflow - what information needs to be provided regarding the model used to create simulation output? Containerization. Can be used as a way to improve repeatibility. 



# Cookbook / DMP work group, Day 3 (Wednesday)

Background: https://fairplus.github.io/the-fair-cookbook/content/home.html
  - What is a "recipe?" Could be useful to define the definition of this and "cookbook" in introduction
    - Not complete, but some answers can be found here:
https://fairplus.github.io/the-fair-cookbook/content/recipes/help/how-to-create-recipe-with-git.html

To do's:
- Create a mailing list -> meeting schedule
- FAIRs fair - review of first draft.


## Create a starting template

What platform/technology should we use for a cookbook? Jupyter book?, jupyter notebook? Github. 

- During the hackathon - use HackMD
- After hackathon, migrate to github (Hamish)
- Q. How to manage pull requests?
    - A. ??

## Challenges
- Searchability
- Practicality of downloading/acquiring
    - Downloading from certain databases (e.g. our own in Dataverse) can be cumbersome, as all has to be downloaded at once. Can it be separated for individual download?
- Environments, containers etc.
- What data is required to be stored? (Storing only certain variables, restart files and ICs, etc.)
- Separate/consolidated metadata
