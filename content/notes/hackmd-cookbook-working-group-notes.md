# Cookbook / DMP work group, Day 2 (Tuesday)


## FAIR cookbooks

Background: https://fairplus.github.io/the-fair-cookbook/content/home.html


### Create a starting template

What platform/technology should we use for a cookbook? Jupyter book?, jupyter notebook? Github. 

- For the use case: Understand what resources are already available. Going forward make sure we have contact with the Bolin centre database managers.



### CMORization - reengineered for research

[ACDD](https://wiki.esipfed.org/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3 ) + [CF](https://cfconventions.org/). Discussion.

Can we test an example of ACDD + CF - is that sufficient metadata for describing research output?

Q. Is ACDD exetensible? At present it seems to be more taylored to measurements rather than model data. Is there a process for adding new attributes?


### Measuring FAIRness: climate data stored on NIRD

One participant demonstrates NIRD storage/DMP. Test this information in f-uji.net. Testable by:

https://www.f-uji.net/index.php 

Enter the DOI of the dataset. 


### Propagating information from DMP to workflow

Information from DMPs should be used to populate metadata (via a cookbook recipe).


## Discussion

- How should we use FAIRness measures? They should not be used to *game* the system as this doesn't necessarily improve the usefulness/(re)usability of the data. Remember, the FAIRness measure is a combination of the FAIRness of the data itself and the repository/archive.

- Separating metadata and data. Data files should be self describing and contain rich metadata. However metadata should also be extracted into a *Data Index* or *Data Catalogue* that does not store the datasets themselves but provides information about where the datasets can be obtained from. Therefore, Data Catalogues are often used to index the content of â€˜Data Repositories and Data Archives.

- For publication of workflow - what information needs to be provided regarding the model used to create simulation output? Containerization. Can be used as a way to improve repeatibility.
